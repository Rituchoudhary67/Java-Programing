Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the
length of the input. 

Linear Time Complexity. O(n) 

It follows the following order in case of time complexity: 

O(nn) > O(n!) > O(n3) > O(n2) > O(n.log(n)) > O(n.log(log(n))) > O(n) > O(sqrt(n)) > O(log(n)) > O(1) 


Space Complexity 

Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of
length of the input. 
It is directly proportional to the largest memory your program acquires at any instance during run time.
